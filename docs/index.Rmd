<br />

These pages show an experimental plot created with data gathered over several family [Quirkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle) matches (note: the proper spelling is actually _qwirkle_, although I've seen it written _qwerkle_ and _quirkle_ as well.  I use the latter mainly because it's a typo that managed to propagate throughout my code, plus I like that spelling).   

- The first page shows the original version of the plot created with `ggplot`  
- The next page shows an interactive version with plotly created with `ggplotly`  
- The last page shows a version created with d3 and rendered here with `r2d3`  

This is a work in progress...
