<br />

These pages show versions of an experimental plot created with data gathered over several Quirkle games (note: the proper spelling is actually _qwerkle_).   

- The first page shows the original version of the plot created with `ggplot`  
- The next page shows an interactive version with plotly created with `ggplotly`  
- The last page shows a version created with d3 and rendered here with `r2d3`  

This is a work in progress...
